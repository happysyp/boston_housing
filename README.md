# Predicting Boston Housing Prices

In this project, the performance and predictive power of a model that was trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts was evaluated. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
